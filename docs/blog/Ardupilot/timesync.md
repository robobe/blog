# Clock/Time Synchronized
The flight controller and companion computer clocks can be synchronized using MAVLinkâ€™s SYSTEM_TIME and TIMESYNC messages. This is important so that each side can blend data from the other side into its EKF.

## Time Synchronization Protocol
This protocol is used to synchronize clocks on MAVLink components by estimating their time offset.

A component that wants to synchronize clocks sends out a TIMESYNC request with its current timestamp in `ts1`. A remote system that supports the protocol sends a TIMESYNC response, including both the original timestamp in `ts1` field and its own timestamp in `tc1`.
