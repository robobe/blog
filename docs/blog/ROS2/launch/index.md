# Tips
## Minimal launch file

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from launch.actions import LogInfo

def generate_launch_description():
    ld = LaunchDescription()

    sim_node =  Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            namespace='turtlesim1',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        )

    log_launch = LogInfo(msg="---- log launch file ------")

    ld.add_action(log_launch)
    ld.add_action(sim_node)
    return ld
```

## copy launch folder
### cmake

```c
install(DIRECTORY
  launch
  DESTINATION share/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```

### python

```python
import os
from glob import glob
from setuptools import setup

package_name = 'py_launch_example'

setup(
    # Other parameters ...
    data_files=[
        # ... Other data files
        # Include all launch files.
        (os.path.join('share', package_name, 'launch'), glob('launch/*launch.[pxy][yma]*'))
    ]
)
```
