## launch source code
```python title="hello.launch.py"
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    ld = LaunchDescription()

    talker_node = Node(
        package="basic",
        executable="simple_pub",
    )

    listener_node = Node(
        package="basic",
        executable="simple_sub"
    )

    ld.add_action(talker_node)
    ld.add_action(listener_node)

    return ld
```

!!! Note
    Your launch file must contain this function: generate_launch_description(), and must return a LaunchDescription object.
