# ROS2 workspace
**Workspace** is a ROS term for the location on your system where youâ€™re developing with ROS 2
The core ROS 2 workspace is called the **underlay**. Subsequent local workspaces are called **overlays**.

**underlay workspace** contain all binary package that install by `apt` or `rosdep` (that run apt)

**overlays workspace** contain source packages get download/clone or develop
when we use `colcon` to build the workspace, it run on the source from `src` folder build into `build` folder and install the result into `install` folder.
colcon create `setup` and `local_setup` files with all the information need to find workspace packages in ROS environment
