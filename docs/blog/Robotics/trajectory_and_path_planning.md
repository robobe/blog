## Speed
Is the time rate at which an object is moving along the path
speed unit are `meters/Second` scalar 



## Velocity
Is the **rate** and **direction** of an object's movement

Velocity unit are vector of `meters/sec` and direction

## uav path planning
Is a process which the UAV finds a 3D space path from the starting point to the destination

## Jerk
Is the change in acceleration over time (m/s^3)

$
\frac{x}{s^{3}}
$


## Path planning
Points moving from one position to other position

## Trajectory Planning
Path from point 1 to point 2 with consider drone limits
