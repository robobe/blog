Snap is a package management system

Snap packages an application as an archive that contains the binary code, data and libraries required to run said application, including any external dependencies.

!!! note "snap vs apt"
    Both enable application management via packages  
    Snap includes everything required to run an application including its dependencies in a single package  
    Apt expects user to deploy dependencies as separate packages.
