# Ping

- ICMP(8) - The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network layer protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues.

**Ping**: command uses ICMP to send a packet to a remote host and wait for a response. This can be used to test the connectivity between two hosts and to measure the round-trip time (RTT) of a packet.

```
ping 8.8.8.8
```

# ifconfig
