# SLAM
Simulations Localization and Mapping: Localizing and Building map at same time 

- Mapping: What dose the world look like
- Localization: Where am i


## Visual
Use Landmarks to estimate robot location

- Using velocity to estimate robot movement


Visual estimation error

## Odometry
Use Origin starting location to estimate robot location
Odometry is the use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time

- Uncertainty
- Slippage
- Motion execution accuracy
- Sensor accuracy


### SLAM Challenge

- Accurate `Localization` needs Accurate `Map` of environment
- Accurate `Mapping` need Accurate `Localization` of the roobot
- Error of estimation
- Environment dynamic


## Dead Reckoning
